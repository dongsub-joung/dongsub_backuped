## Systemstats Assertion Failed Error  

[Systemstats Assertions Failed Error in Console App](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/336512-systemstats-assertion-failed-error-in-console-app-solved/)  
I tracked it down to the VoodooI2C kext. There was a memory leak in the kext and it was causing kernel_task to steadily increase RAM usage while using the laptop until it maxed out all 32gigs of RAM, which then caused the system to try and shut down and crash.   
Problem was fixed in the latest version of VoodooI2C that patched the memory leak.  

I've tried disabling apps and non-essential kexts as well as changing the system identifier as part of my troubleshooting so far.

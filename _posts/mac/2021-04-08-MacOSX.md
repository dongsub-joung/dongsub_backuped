## launchd
* User: root
* Process group: launchd

This particular process, launchd, is the service management framework used by macOS, similar in some ways to Service Control Manager on Windows or systemd on many Linux distributions. A “service” is anything running in the background; on macOS these are commonly referred to as daemons and generally have names ending with the letter “d.” Most everything your Mac does—connecting to networks, showing things on the display, and backing up your files—is done by a daemon on some level.

## mDNSresponder
* User: (underbar)mdnsresponder 
* Process group: mDNSResponder

Today’s process, mDNSResponder, is a core part of the  [Bonjour protocol](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/) . Bonjour is Apple’s zero-configuration networking service, which basically means it’s how Apple devices find each other on a network. Our process, mDNSResponder, regularly scans your local network looking for other Bonjour-enabled devices.

> Bonjour is the reason this works: the protocol allows two computers on the same network to easily find each other, meaning the list of shared iTunes libraries is always up-to-date.
